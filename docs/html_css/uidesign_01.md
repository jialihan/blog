## UI Web Design basics
### 1. Beautiful Typography
According to wiki:

**Typography** is the art and technique of [arranging type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting "Typesetting") to make [written language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_language "Written language")  [legible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legibility "Legibility"), [readable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability "Readability"), and [appealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty "Beauty") when displayed.

Common practice and rules:

* use a **font size** between 15 and 25 pixels for body text.
* use bigger font sizes for **headlines and titles**: eg: 60px to 90px.
* use **line spaceing** between 120% - 150%: make text easy to read
	CSS line spacing is affected by the CSS style property `line-height`
	normal

	1 ) A normal line height. This is default
	```
	{
		line-height:  normal;
	}
	```
	2 ) A number that will be multiplied with the current font-size to set the line height
	```
	{
		line-height:  1.21;
	}
	```
	3 ) _length_: A fixed line height in px, pt, cm, etc.
	```
	{
		line-height:  0.5cm;
	}
	```
	 4 ) percentage _%_:  A line height in percent of the current font size
	 ```
	{
		line-height:  80%;
	}
	```

* 45 to 90 **characters** per line
* **Use good fonts**
 For example: `Serif` typefaces are usually used for more traditional purposes that encourage long reading and story telling.

### 2. Meaning of Colors in web design
* Only use  **one base color**
 you can create a darker or lighter version of base-color. There are tools like: 0to255.
 * use a tool to use more colors
 * use color to draw attention
 pick a color that stands out and use it mostly to draw attention to a button or any other element of importance on your website
 * never use black in your design
 * choose colors wisely
    For example:
    - `red`: a great color to use when power, passion, strength and excitement want to be transmitted.
    - `Orange`:  draws attention without being as overpowering as red. It means cheerfulness and creativity. Orange can be associated with friendliness, confidence and courage.
    - `yellow`:  energetic and gives the feeling of happiness and liveliness. Also it associates with curiosity, intelligence, brightness, etc.
    - `green`:  the color of harmony, nature, life and health. Also it is often associated with money. In design green can have a balancing and harmonizing effect.
    - `blue`: means patience, peace, trustworthiness and stability. It is one of the most beloved colors, especially by men.
    - `purple`:  is traditionally associated with power, nobility and wealth. In your design purple can give a sense of wisdom, royalty, nobility, luxury and mystery.
    - `pink` :   expresses romance, passivity, care, peace, affection, etc.
	- `brown`:   itself means earthiness, nature, durability, comfort and reliability. 

### 3.  use images
How to put text over images?
*  directly put text on the image
    it needs strong contrast to make it obvious.
* Overlay the Image with a color
you can use a darker color or use color gradients to achieve stunning effects.
* Put your text in a box
* Blur the image
* The floor fade:
The floor fade is a technique where an image subtly fades towards black at the bottom. With white text written over it.

### 4. use icons
* use icons to list `feature/steps`
* use icons for `actions and links`
   - icons should be recognizable and remove open interpretation.
   - label your icons if you have enough space to do so, avoid to confuse your users.
 *  icons should `not take a center stage `
 *  use icon fonts whenever possible
   vector icon font, that's because vectors scale endlessly up or down for any resolution

### 5. spacing and layout
1 ) `whitespace`:   Whitespace absolutely is the key to create a clean and simple look and feel. Some tips for using whitespace:
* Put whitespace between your elements
* Put whitespace between your groups of elements
* Put whitespace between your website's sections
* don't exaggerate

2 ) Define hierarchy
you describe invisible relationships between the elements of your web site. Hierarchies give your web site order. 
* Define where you want  your audience to look first
* Establish a flow that corresponds to your content's message
* Use whitespace to build that flow
### 6. use experience
User Experience is the `presentation of a product`, how it looks and feels.
User experience is the `overall experience` that the user has with a product.
```
Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.
Design is how it works.
             --------- Steve Jobs
```

### 7. Inspiration 
Ask yourself when begin to design:
* collect designs you like
* try to understand everything about them
* why they look good
* what these sites have in common?
* how they were built in HTML and CSS
