- Data Privacy: Ensuring that user data is collected, stored, and processed with consent and in compliance with regulations (like GDPR). Engineers must be vigilant about protecting sensitive information.
- Security: Developing software that is secure against vulnerabilities. Ethical considerations include the responsibility to protect users from data breaches and cyberattacks.
- Bias and Fairness: Addressing biases in algorithms, especially in AI and machine learning. Engineers must strive to create systems that are fair and do not perpetuate discrimination against any group.
- Algorithmic bias
  You need to remember that **computers lack morality**! Bias can unintentionally enter systems when itâ€™s not taken into consideration. Companies and senior-level employees can also work to solve algorithmic bias by nurturing a culture that **encourages employees to speak up if they believe a software feature is problematic**.
- Transparency: Providing clear explanations of how software works, especially in automated decision-making systems. Users should understand how their data is used and how decisions are made.
- Intellectual Property: Respecting copyright and licensing agreements when using third-party code or libraries. Engineers must ensure that they are not infringing on others' intellectual property rights.
- Sustainability: Considering the environmental impact of software development and data centers. Engineers may face ethical dilemmas regarding energy consumption and resource use.
- User Manipulation: Avoiding dark patterns that manipulate users into making decisions they might not otherwise make. This includes ethical marketing practices and user experience design.
- Job Displacement: The impact of automation and AI on employment. Engineers should consider the societal implications of their work and how it affects job security for various professions.
- Open Source vs. Proprietary Software: Balancing the benefits of open-source contributions with the need for proprietary solutions that can fund development and support.

3. Be accountable engineer
   You should strive to improve the integrity and reputation of the profession as a software engineer. For instance, you should avoid making false claims regarding your application that could be deceptive or misleading. Make sure you keep your employer, clients, customers, and other stakeholders in the loop by reporting software issues and other potential ethical issues in software development
