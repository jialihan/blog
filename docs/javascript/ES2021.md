### I. Numeric separators

ES2021 supports `_` which can be placed as numeric separator. When one billion can be written as `1_000_000_000` in code, it is way easier to read.
For example:

```
// A billion
const amount = 1_000_000_000;

// 6234500 cents (62345 dollars)
const amount = 62345_00;

// 20^30000
const amount = 2e30_000;
```

Also can be used for Binary, Hex, Octal bases, eg:

```
// hex
const a = 0xF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF
// binary
const b = 0b10000000_00000000_00000000_00000000
```

The underscore(`_`) separator also works with BigInt numbers.

```javascript
const trillion = 1000_000_000_000n;
console.log(trillion.toString()); // "1000000000000"
```

### II. String replaceAll

MDN docs: [`replaceAll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll)

In the past, we have to use `regex` to replace all chars in a string, now we can use this new method.

- with regex (past)

  ```
  const message = 'hello+this+is+javascript';
  const messageWithSpace = message.replace(/\+/g, ' ');

  // hello this is javascript
  ```

- without regex (now)

  ```
  const message = 'hello+this+is+javascript';
  const messageWithSpace = message.replaceAll('+', ' ')

  // hello this is javascript
  ```

### III. Logical assignment operator

<div id="ch3-1" />

#### 3.1 And & Equals (&&=)

This operator is saying that if the variable `a` has a **truthy** value, then variable `a` should be assigned the value of the variable `b`.

```
let a = 1;
let b =2;
a &&= b;
// output: a = 2
```

This is similar to the following logic:

```
if(a)
{
	a=b;
}
```

<div id="ch3-2" />

#### 3.2 OR & Equals (||=)

This operator is the **opposite** of the `&&=` operator. In this, the variable `a` will be equal to the variable `b` **only and only if** the variable `a` has a **falsy** value.

```
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
a ||= b;
console.log(a); // output for variable 'a' would be 1.
```

This is similar to the following logic:

```
if(!a)
{
	a=b;
}
```

<div id="ch3-3" />

#### 3.3 Nullish Coalescing & Equals (??=)

This operator checks whether a value is **null** or is **undefined**.

```
let a;
let b=2;
a ??= b;
console.log(a); // output is 2
```

This is similar to the following logic:

```
if(a===null || a===undefined)
{
	a=b;
}
```

### IV. Promise.any()

MDN doc: [`Promise.any`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any)

It returns a single promise that resolves as soon as any of the promises in the iterable fulfills, with the value of the fulfilled promise. If no promises in the iterable fulfill (if all of the given promises are rejected), then the returned promise is rejected with an [`AggregateError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AggregateError),

```
try {
  const first = await Promise.any([
    p1, p2, p2
  ]);
  // Any of the promises was fulfilled.
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
  // AggregateError: All promises were rejected
}
```

### V. WeakRef

MDN doc: [`WeakRef`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakRef)

A **`WeakRef`** object lets you hold a weak reference to another object, without preventing that object from getting garbage-collected.

```
const originObj = {name: "jelly", age: "18"};
const refObj = new WeakRef(originObj);
const obj = refObj.deref();

obj.name // Output: 'jelly'
```

### VI. Finalizers

MDN doc: [`Finalizers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/FinalizationRegistry)

**Basic usage:**

```
// register the callback for future use
const registry = new FinalizationRegistry(heldValue => {
  // ....
});

// register the object
registry.register(theObject, "some value");
```

**More usages:**

If you might want to unregister an object `later`, you pass a third value, which is the _unregistration token_ you'll use later when calling the registry's `unregister` function to unregister the object. The registry only keeps a weak reference to the unregister token.

It's common to use the object itself as the unregister token, which is just fine:

```
registry.register(theObject, "some value", theObject);
// ...some time later, if you don't care about `theObject` anymore...
registry.unregister(theObject);
```

It doesn't have to be the same object, though; it can be a different one:

```
registry.register(theObject, "some value", tokenObject);
// ...some time later, if you don't care about `theObject` anymore...
registry.unregister(tokenObject);
```
